# NyaaScrape-qBittorrent
A simple script that scrapes the download page of the site, writes the information from the page to a text file, and saves that text file at the location of the download. Useful if the author has included detailed descriptions about the release, or if the torrent is ever taken down, or if you want to know the particular date of the release in case you want to update to something newer.
